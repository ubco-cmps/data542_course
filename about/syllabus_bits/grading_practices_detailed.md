The grading scheme for this course is here:

```{attention} 
Data 542 labs are **intentionally** long because I believe the best way to learn data wrangling is to do a LOT of it. To compensate for the extra time I expect you to spend working on labs, Data 542 will have no quizzes. Be warned!
```

| Item  | Weight | Due Date                |

| Lab 1 | 25%    | Tuesday Jan 18 at 18:00 |
| Lab 2 | 25%    | Tuesday Jan 25 at 18:00 |
| Lab 3 | 25%    | Tuesday Feb 1 at 18:00  |
| Lab 4 | 25%    | Tuesday Feb 8 18:00     |

```{attention} 
All (non-quiz) deadlines in this course have an automatic 48 hour grace period after the due dates listed above.
Any submissions submitted past the grace period will not be graded.
